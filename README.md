Welcome to the **Salesian Times** repository! This project is an interactive, web-based game designed to engage users in discovering the core principles of Salesian spirituality through an outdoor challenge.

---

## Project Overview

**Salesian Times** is an interactive experience where participants solve a puzzle by discovering four key Salesian principles inscribed on an outdoor wall. Once the correct words are submitted on the login page, users are redirected to a secret instruction page with additional guidance.

## Features

1. **Home Page**  
   - Presents a styled newsfeed featuring articles related to community and youth development.
   - Includes a login form where participants input the four discovered Salesian principles.

2. **Secret Page**  
   - Displays a congratulatory message and detailed descriptions of the four principles: **school, playground, home, and church**.
   - Provides instructions for the next steps in the interactive game.

3. **Responsive Design**  
   - The project uses inline CSS directly within the HTML files for styling, ensuring simplicity and ease of deployment.
   - No external CSS file is required.

4. **Cloudflare Pages Hosting**  
   - The website is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** and is accessible at:  
     [https://salesian-times.salesianipardubice.cz](https://salesian-times.salesianipardubice.cz).

5. **Compact File Structure**  
   - Contains only essential HTML files (`index.html` and `secret.html`) with embedded styles and scripts for straightforward deployment.

## Core Principles

### 1. School
Salesian schools focus on more than just academic learning. They aim to nurture character and values, providing an environment where students feel respected and supported by their teachers and peers.

### 2. Playground
Symbolizing joy and community, the playground fosters collaboration, mutual respect, and lifelong friendships. It is a space of enthusiasm and shared experiences.

### 3. Home
Home represents acceptance and safety. The Salesian approach creates a family-like atmosphere where everyone feels valued and supported.

### 4. Church
The church signifies the spiritual dimension of Salesian life, encouraging a living and joyful faith. It is a place for reflection, service, and community.

## How It Works

2. **Step 2**: Enter the discovered words into the login form on the home page.
